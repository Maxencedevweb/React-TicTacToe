# React + Vite Project

Made by myself without following any tutorial (to compare to the React official Tutorial at the end)

To try it : 
1) Clone the git repo
```git clone git@github.com:Maxencedevweb/React-TicTacToe.git```
2) Open a Terminal and Install dependencies
```npm i```
3) Start it
```npm run dev```
